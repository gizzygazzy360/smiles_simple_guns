# smiles_simple_guns
So, i decided to release my gun datapack on github making it open source.
I personally don't really care to work on the pack anymore so yeah.

If people create pull requests I will merge them into the main branch.

there are tons of bugs in this build as of 9/11/2020. please report them when you find them.
